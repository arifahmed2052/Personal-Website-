            <div class="overview-box">
                <p>This Digital Capstone Project examines how misinformation spreads differently in Bangladesh and the United States, influenced by culture, media literacy, and digital platform use. Through research and personal observation, this project explores the mechanisms behind digital misinformation, the role of social media algorithms, and the real-world consequences of believing and sharing false information online.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To raise awareness about how quickly false information spreads and to provide practical strategies for verifying online content before sharing it.</p>

        <!-- Background Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Background and Personal Connection</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Bangladesh, I witnessed firsthand how misinformation shaped what people believed. My parents and relatives would share viral posts on Facebook and videos on WhatsApp that appeared credible but were often false. These ranged from fabricated medical advice to edited political clips that spread rapidly through family group chats.</p>

                <p class="caption">Photo by AFP. Visual representation of how misinformation spreads through social media networks, reaching thousands of users within hours.</p>
            </div>

            <p>When I came to the United States for university, I noticed similar patterns, particularly around the 2020 presidential election, the COVID-19 pandemic, and social movements. Despite the vastly different cultures, languages, and political systems, the underlying mechanisms were remarkably similar: emotional content, sensational headlines, and algorithm-driven amplification.</p>
            
            <p>This realization transformed my understanding of misinformation from a local problem to a global phenomenon. Through this research, I seek to understand how false information affects societies across borders and what we can do to become more critical consumers of digital content.</p>

            <h2>Research Findings</h2>
            
            <h3>What the Data Reveals</h3>
            <div class="findings-list">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>False news spreads significantly faster than truth.</strong> Research by Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral (2018) analyzing millions of tweets found that false information reaches 1,500 people six times faster than accurate information. False news was 70% more likely to be retweeted than true news.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Social media algorithms amplify misinformation.</strong> Automated accounts (bots) and engagement-driven algorithms prioritize content that generates strong emotional reactions, often spreading misinformation in the process (Shao et al., 2018). Platforms reward engagement over accuracy.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Cultural context shapes belief in misinformation.</strong> In Bangladesh, lower media literacy rates and limited fact-checking resources contribute to widespread belief in false information (Al-Zaman, 2021). In the United States, political polarization and echo chambers reinforce existing beliefs regardless of factual accuracy.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Platforms reward viral content regardless of truth.</strong> Content that generates high engagement—regardless of accuracy—is promoted by algorithms designed to maximize user interaction and time spent on platform (Yale School of Management, 2021).</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Misinformation creates psychological stress.</strong> According to UNICEF Bangladesh (2020), misinformation is the leading cause of stress for youth on social media. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the psychological effects of encountering false information online.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The visualization below compares how low-credibility content spreads versus fact-checked information on social media. Each circle represents a network of users sharing content—the larger and denser the circles, the wider the reach.</p>

                <p class="caption">Online virality of low-credibility versus fact-checked content. The stark difference shows that misleading articles reach tens of thousands of users almost instantly, while verified information spreads much more slowly. This reveals how social media systems are built to prioritize emotional and viral content over accuracy. Adapted from Shao, C., Ciampaglia, G. L., Varol, O., Flammini, A., & Menczer, F. (2018).

        <!-- Comparison Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Bangladesh vs. United States: Different Contexts, Similar Patterns</h2>
            
            <p><strong>In Bangladesh:</strong> Misinformation spreads primarily through Facebook and WhatsApp, where millions of users rely on these platforms as their main news source. People often trust content because it comes from friends or family members, rarely questioning its validity. The lack of widespread media literacy education and limited fact-checking resources exacerbate the problem (Al-Zaman, 2021).</p>
            
            <p><strong>In the United States:</strong> Misinformation spreads through larger online communities and is amplified by political polarization. People follow pages and accounts that match their existing beliefs, creating echo chambers where false information is reinforced rather than challenged. During the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 election, misinformation spread faster than factual reporting (Cinelli et al., 2020).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Common Thread:</strong> In both countries, emotion drives the spread. Content that triggers fear, anger, or outrage spreads faster than neutral, factual information. Social media algorithms, designed to maximize engagement, inadvertently reward misinformation by giving it greater visibility.</p>

                <h3>Case Study: China's Influencer Regulation</h3>
                
                <div class="visual-container" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">

                </div>
                
                <p>In 2025, China implemented strict regulations requiring influencers to have verified degrees in specific fields (health, education, law) before discussing these topics online. The law also bans hidden advertisements for medical and health products often disguised as educational content (The Economic Times, 2025).</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Debate:</strong> This regulation sparked global discussion about the balance between public safety and freedom of expression. Supporters argue it protects citizens from dangerous misinformation spread by unqualified "experts." Critics view it as censorship that limits creativity and personal storytelling.</p>
                
                <p><strong>My Perspective:</strong> While China's approach may seem extreme, it reflects a real problem—unverified "experts" spreading health misinformation can have serious consequences. However, complete restriction isn't the answer. Better solutions include platform transparency, clear labeling of expert vs. personal content, and improved media literacy education rather than outright bans.</p>

            <div class="tips-section">
                <h3>Practical Verification Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check the source.</strong> Verify that information comes from a credible news organization or official source. Be wary of unfamiliar website names or pages that mimic legitimate news outlets.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Check the date.</strong> Old news is often recirculated during similar events, creating unnecessary panic. Always verify when information was originally published.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Cross-reference with multiple sources.</strong> If only one outlet is reporting a major story, it may not be accurate. Check at least two other reputable sources before believing or sharing.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Notice your emotional reaction.</strong> Misinformation is designed to trigger strong emotions—fear, anger, excitement. If content makes you feel intense emotion immediately, pause before sharing and verify the information first.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Reverse search images and videos.</strong> Use Google Images or TinEye to check if media has been taken out of context or manipulated. Many viral posts use real images but present them with false information.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Use fact-checking websites.</strong> Sites like Snopes, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact specialize in verifying viral claims, especially about science, health, and politics.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Be skeptical of sensational headlines.</strong> If a headline seems too shocking to be true, read the full article. Headlines are often designed for clicks rather than accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"><strong>Remember:</strong> Every share multiplies the reach of information. Taking a few seconds to verify before clicking "share" can prevent false information from reaching hundreds or thousands of people.</p>

                <h3>Practical Verification Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check the source.</strong> Verify that information comes from a credible news organization or official source. Be wary of unfamiliar website names or pages that mimic legitimate news outlets.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Check the date.</strong> Old news is often recirculated during similar events, creating unnecessary panic. Always verify when information was originally published.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Cross-reference with multiple sources.</strong> If only one outlet is reporting a major story, it may not be accurate. Check at least two other reputable sources before believing or sharing.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Notice your emotional reaction.</strong> Misinformation is designed to trigger strong emotions—fear, anger, excitement. If content makes you feel intense emotion immediately, pause before sharing and verify the information first.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Reverse search images and videos.</strong> Use Google Images or TinEye to check if media has been taken out of context or manipulated. Many viral posts use real images but present them with false information.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Use fact-checking websites.</strong> Sites like Snopes, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact specialize in verifying viral claims, especially about science, health, and politics.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Be skeptical of sensational headlines.</strong> If a headline seems too shocking to be true, read the full article. Headlines are often designed for clicks rather than accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"><strong>Remember:</strong> Every share multiplies the reach of information. Taking a few seconds to verify before clicking "share" can prevent false information from reaching hundreds or thousands of people.</p>

                <p>Working on this project fundamentally changed how I view social media and online information. I used to scroll through feeds without questioning what I saw, trusting that if something appeared credible or came from someone I knew, it was probably true. Now I understand that belief in misinformation isn't about intelligence—it's about how our emotions and social connections intersect with algorithmic systems designed for engagement.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">I've seen how misinformation affects both of my homes—Bangladesh and the United States. In Bangladesh, trust in family and community makes people vulnerable to false information shared through personal networks. In the United States, political polarization makes people trust information that aligns with their beliefs over objective facts. In both cases, emotion drives belief before logic, and social media amplifies this tendency.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>My Key Takeaway:</strong> We all have power in the digital world. Every like, share, and comment contributes to what information spreads. By taking a few extra seconds to verify before sharing, we can reduce the spread of misinformation and make online spaces safer and more reliable for everyone.</p>
